# Competitive Programmming

Welcome to my competitive programming library. This repo contains my working
directory and templates/snippets I used in competitive programming. Lots of
inspiration taken from other coders! If you would like to use the debug header
file, make sure you update the (hardcoded) path in the template, and compile
with the LOCAL flag.
